# Linear Mixed Effects Regression Analysis

Mar. 22, 2025 - Lily

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to run the linear mixed effects regression analysis.

## Material
1. R studio
2. gc_rare.RData (phyloseq object generated during P09)
3. LME_code.R (emailed by Ritu)

## Methods

1. Open the LME_code.R project emailed by Ritu in R Studio.
2. Run the code and plot the regression lines for each cancer stage.
3. Save the plot as .png files locally and upload to Github.
4. Run Spearman's correlation analysis for each cancer stage separately.

## Code
[R Script for Linear Mixed Effects Regression Analysis](/Rscripts/LMEScript.R)

## Output Files
1. PD_across_age_for_different_cancer_stages.png
2. Spearman's_correlation.png

Note: All files listed above can be found [here](/Rscripts/visuals).

## Results
> <img src="/Rscripts/visuals/PD_across_age_for_different_cancer_stages.png" height="200"> 
> <img src="/Rscripts/visuals/Spearman's_correlation.png" height="200">

## Discussion
- All p-values for Spearman's correlation are >0.05, so the correlation results reflected are insignificant.

## Future Directions
- Completed data analysis!!
