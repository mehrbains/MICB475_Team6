# QIIME 2 Training Classifier and Taxonomic Analysis

Feb. 21, 2025 - Tricia

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to retrain the classifier and perform taxonomic analysis.  

## Material
1. QIIME2
2. silva-138-99-seqs.qza (Pathway in server: /mnt/datasets/silva_ref_files/silva-138-99-seqs.qza)
3. silva-138-99-tax.qza (Pathway in server: mnt/datasets/silva_ref_files/silva-138-99-tax.qza)

## Method

1. Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided team 6 login credentials.
2. Create a detached screen called "training". Extract amplicon of interest from the reference database into a new ref-seq file. 
3. Create a new detached screen called "classifier". Train the classifier with the new ref-seq file.
4. Create a new detached screen called "taxonomy". Assign taxonomy to the reads using the new trained classifier.
5. Convert taxonomy.qza file into a qzv file.
6. Create a taxonomy barplot qzv file.
7. Transfer all qzv files to local computer and view the files on (https://view.qiime2.org/)

## Code
[QIIME Code](/QIIME2/Data_Processing_Script.txt)

## Output Files
1. /data/project_2/ref-seqs-trimmed.qza
2. /data/project_2/classifier.qza
3. /data/project_2/taxonomy.qza
4. [/data/project_2/taxonomy.qzv](/QIIME2/exports/taxonomy.qzv)
5. [/data/project_2/taxa-bar-plots.qzv](/QIIME2/visuals/taxonomy_bar_plot)

## Results
- the classifier was retrained with forward and reverse primers of V3 and V4 with a truncation length of 223, the truncation length chosen for denoising.

Taxonomy bar plot - Image from https://view.qiime2.org/
- Original file was too big to be uploaded onto Github so a screenshot of a third of the samples is included here instead.
- Image is from taxonomy level 6 since QIIME2 view had difficulties loading level 7

## Discussion

## Future Directions
- filter out mitochondria and chloroplast from table-223.qza file
- generate a tree for phylogenetic diversity analyses
- generate an alpha rarefaction curve
