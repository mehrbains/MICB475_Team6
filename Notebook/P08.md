# QIIME 2 Filtering out features with <5 reads and Calculate alpha- and beta-diversity metrics

Feb. 28, 2025 - Tricia

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to filter out <5 reads from the no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast table for subsequent processing and analysis using PICRUSt2 and to generate an alpha rarefaction curve from the new generated feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza file.

## Material
1. QIIME2
2. table-no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast.qza (Pathway in server: /data/project_2/table-no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast.qza)
3. updated_v2_gastric_cancer_metadata.tsv (Pathway in server: /data/project_2/updated_v2_gastric_cancer_metadata.tsv)

## Method

1. Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided team 6 login credentials.
2. Filter out features with <5 reads from the table-no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast.qza file.
3. Generate a new alpha rarefaction curve using the feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza.
4. Calculate alpha- and beta-diversity metrics and input all files into a new directory called "core-metrics-results-12000"

## Code
[QIIME PICRUSt2 Code](/QIIME2/PICRUSt2/PICRUSt2_Script.txt)
[QIIME Metrics Code](/QIIME2/Data_Processing_Script.txt)

## Output Files
1. [/data/project_2/feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza](/QIIME2/exports/feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza)
2. /data/project_2/core-metrics-results-12000
3. [/data/project_2/alpha-rarefaction-filtered.qzv](/QIIME2/visuals/alpha-rarefaction-filtered.png)

## Results
- Features with <5 reads were filtered out from the table-no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast.qza file.

The alpha rarefaction curves generated from both the table-223.qza file and feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza file show similar curvature and plateau point. 

## Discussion

## Future Directions
- begin PICRUSt2 analysis using the feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza
- export all required files from qiime2 to local computer for further analyses performed in R studio.
