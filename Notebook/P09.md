# Indicator Species Analysis

March 2, 2025 - Shreya

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to perform indicator species analysis using the phyloseq object developed in P08 and an updated metadata category that combines the age group (Young Adult, Middle Age, and Elderly) with each cancer stage.

## Material
1. R studio
2. Phyloseq object from P08 
3. updated_v2_gastric_cancer_metadata.tsv (Pathway in server: /data/project_2/updated_v2_gastric_cancer_metadata.tsv)

1. Create a new grouping variable combining cancer stage and age group in the gc genus
2. Run ISA by forming clusters based on the Stage_Age variable
3. Filter based on p < 0.05 and stat >= 0.07 or 0.08.

## Code

Rscripts/Aim3/ISA.R

## Output Files


gc_final.RData
gc_rare.RData
isa_table.csv

## Results

When stat is greater or equal to 0.8, ISA identifies one ASV associated with an uncultured Polyangiaceae species belonging to the Sandaracinaceae family in elderly individuals experiencing intestinal metaplasia (the second stage of gastric cancer progression). There is little informatiton available about this species; during team meeting, it was suggested we refer to it at the genus level instead. 

When stat is greater or equal to 0.7, ISA identifies an additional ASV associated with the Clostridiaceae family/Sarcina genus (but the species is unidentified) in middle-aged individuals experiencing full-fledged gastric cancer.

## Discussion



## Future Directions

Begin PICRUSt2 analysis and examine whether these signifigant microbes are related to any pathway changes.
