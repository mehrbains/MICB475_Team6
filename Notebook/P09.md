March 2, 2025 - Shreya

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to perform indicator species analysis based on the 

## Material
1. R studio
2. Phyloseq object from P09

1. Create a new grouping variable combining cancer stage and age group in the gc genus
2. Run ISA by forming clusters based on the Stage_Age variable
3. Filter based on p < 0.05.

## Code

Rscripts/Aim3/ISA.R

## Output Files



## Results

Each Stage_Age value has a minimum of one predictor taxa that it is associated with - suggests that this can be used as a biomarker!

*Need to check with Ritu about understanding

## Discussion

## Future Directions
- begin PICRUSt2 analysis
