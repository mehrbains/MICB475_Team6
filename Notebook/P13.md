# PERMANOVA testing for statistical analysis

Mar. 9, 2025 - Lily

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to perform PERMANOVA testing for statistical analysis and generate PCoA plots in R Studio to address Aim 2.

## Material
1. R studio
2. gc_rare.RData (phyloseq object generated during P09)

## Methods

1. Open R Studio and load tidyverse, phyloseq, vegan, and ggforce libraries and the rarefied data.
2. Measure the weighted unifrac distance in the rarefied phyloseq object and plot it as an ordination to a PCoA plot.
3. Run the permanova on the above matrix for weighted unifrac, then other metrics including Bray and Jaccard.
4. Re-plot the above PCoA with ellipses to show a significant difference between age groups and gc stages using ggplot2.
6. Save all plots as .png files locally and upload to Github.

## Code
[R Script for PERMANOVA Statistical Analysis](/Rscripts/PermanovaScript.R)

## Output Files
1. weighted_unifrac_PCoA.png
2. PCoA_plot_w_ellipses.png
3. Zoomedin_PCoA_plot_w_ellipses.png

Note: All files listed above can be found [here](/Rscripts/visuals).

## Discussion
- The "Healthy Control" category appears to cluster seperately from all the gastric cancer stages (no elderly age category for healthy controls), indicating that the PERMANOVA statistical analysis was successful.
- The PCoA plot with ellipses appears to cluster all gastric cancer stages across all age categories similarly - ask Ritu about the significance values produced by adonis2, bray-curtis, and jaccard in R Studio.
- There may be no significant differences in gastric mucosal microbiota composition across gastric cancer stages and age groups.

## Future Directions
