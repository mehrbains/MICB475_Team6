# QIIME 2 Denoising Gastric Cancer Dataset

Feb. 13, 2025 - Tricia

## Purpose
Denoising is a process done to detect and correct sequencing errors, followed by the clustering of sequences into respective ASVs. 

## Material
1. QIIME2
2. gastric_cancer_demux_seqs.qza (Pathway in server: /data/project_2)
3. gastric_cancer_metadata.tsv (Pathway in server: /mnt/datasets/project_2/gastric_cancer)

## Method

1. Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided team 6 login credentials.
2. Create a detached screen named "denoising" to allow for denoising to occur overnight.
3. Denoise and cluster gastric_cancer_demux_seqs.qza using DADA2.
4. Create a visualization for the ASVs by converting all qza files into qzv files. 
5. Transfer the visualization files to your local computer directory and view it using view.QIIME2.org. 

## Code
[QIIME Code](/QIIME2/Data_Processing_Script.txt)

## Output Files
1. /data/project_2/rep-seqs-223.qza
2. [/data/project_2/rep-seqs-223.qzv](/QIIME2/exports/reps-seqs-223.qzv)
3. /data/project_2/table-223.qza
4. [/data/project_2/table-223.qzv](/QIIME2/exports/table-223.qzv)
5. /data/project_2/stats-223.qza

## Results
1. Total number of reads retained: 5, 199, 423
2. Total number of ASVs: 20, 716
3. Total number of samples: 310
4. Range of sequencing depth: 3, 339 - 174, 487

## Discussion
The total number of samples (310) remained the same prior to denoising because all samples had reads of 223bp long. 

## Future Directions
