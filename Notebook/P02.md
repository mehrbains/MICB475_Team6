# QIIME 2 Denoising Gastric Cancer Dataset

Feb. 13, 2025 - Tricia

## Purpose
Denoising is a process done to detect and correct sequencing errors, followed by the clustering of sequences into respective ASVs. 

## Material
1. QIIME2
2. gastric_cancer_demux_seqs.qza (Pathway in server: /data/project_2)
3. gastric_cancer_metadata.tsv (Pathway in server: /mnt/datasets/project_2/gastric_cancer)

## Method

1. Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided team 6 login credentials.
2. Create a detached screen named "denoising" to allow for denoising to occur overnight.
3. Denoise and cluster gastric_cancer_demux_seqs.qza using DADA2.
4. Create a visualization for the ASVs by converting all qza files into qzv files. 
5. Transfer the visualization files to your local computer directory and view it using view.QIIME2.org.
