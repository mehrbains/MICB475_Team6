# Beta-Diversity Analysis with the Weighted Unifrac Distance Metric

Mar. 7, 2025 - Mehr

## Purpose
The purpose of this session is to produce figures for beta diversity analysis using the weighted unifrac distance metric, in R Studio. This analysis will be done for each category under the 'Group' metadata variable, generating a total of 5 plots for Aim 2 of Project 2.

## Material
1. R studio
2. gc_rare.RData (phyloseq object generated during P09)

## Method

1. Open R Studio and load libraries as well as phyloseq object.
2. For each category under the 'Group' variable: subset samples, and generate PCoA plot with the weighted unifrac distance metric.
3. Save all plots as .png files locally and upload to Github. 

## Code
[R Script for Beta Diversity Analysis](/Rscripts/Beta_Diversity_Script.R)

## Output Files
1. plot_pcoa_cg.png
2. plot_pcoa_gc.png
3. plot_pcoa_healthy.png
4. plot_pcoa_im.png
5. plot_pcoa_in.png

Note: All files listed above can be found [here](/Rscripts/visuals).

## Discussion
- Intestinal metaplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia categories do not have any samples that fall within the 'young adult' age group.
- All graphs appear to show age categories clustering together/overlapping, which might suggest there's no significant difference in beta diversity among age groups within each 'Group' category.

## Future Directions
- Perform PERMANOVA test for statistical analysis
