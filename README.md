### Research Question: How does the composition and function of the gastric mucosal microbiome vary with age across different stages of gastric cancer?

### Experimental Aims
- Aim 1: Analyze the relationship between age and alpha diversity of the gastric mucosal microbiome for different stages of gastric cancer
- Aim 2: Identify if age has a significant effect on the beta diversity of the gastric mucosal microbiome at different stages of gastric cancer
- Aim 3: Identify microbial taxa that are strongly associated with distinct stages of gastric cancer across age cohorts
- Aim 4: Investigate the impact of age on gastric mucosal metabolic function within each stage of gastric cance
